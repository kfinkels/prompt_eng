      "**Improvements and Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Data Types:**  `reservation_time` should ideally be a proper datetime type (e.g., `datetime.datetime`)  for easier querying and sorting. SQLModel handles this well with appropriate database support.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Password Security:**  **Never** store passwords in plain text. Use a robust password hashing algorithm (like bcrypt or Argon2) to securely store password hashes.  You'll need a separate library for this.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Unique Constraints:**  The model includes `unique=True` for `username` and `email` in the `User` model to enforce uniqueness.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Relationships:**  The `Relationship` field establishes the connections between tables (one-to-many relationships).  The `back_populates` argument creates efficient bidirectional relationships, allowing easy access to related data from either side. For example, you can easily get all reservations for a given user or all users who have reservations at a given restaurant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Restaurant Attributes:**  The `Restaurant` model currently includes only basic attributes.  Consider adding fields relevant to your app, such as:\n",
      "    * `cuisine`: (e.g., Italian, Mexican, etc.)\n",
      "    * `price_range`: (e.g., $, $$, $$$)\n",
      "    * `hours_of_operation`: (using a suitable data type to represent opening and closing times)\n",
      "    * `average_rating`: (a floating-point number for average user ratings)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Reservation Attributes:**  Similarly, expand the `Reservation` model with fields like:\n",
      "    * `status`: (e.g., \"pending\", \"confirmed\", \"cancelled\")\n",
      "    * `special_requests`: (text field for any special requests)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Error Handling and Validation:** You should add more robust validation and error handling (beyond what SQLModel provides by default).  For example, you might want to check that the number of people in a reservation is positive, or that the reservation time is in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Database Choice:** This model works with various SQL databases supported by SQLAlchemy (the underlying library of SQLModel).  Choose a database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.) that suits your project's needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Search Optimization:** For efficient searching of restaurants near a user's location, consider adding a spatial index to the database (if your database supports it) to optimize queries based on geographic coordinates.  You might want to add `latitude` and `longitude` fields to the `Location` model for this purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember to install the necessary libraries: `pip install sqlmodel psycopg2-binary` (replace `psycopg2-binary` with the appropriate database driver if you're not using PostgreSQL).  Then you can create tables from this model using SQLModel's functionality (e.g., `SQLModel.metadata.create_all()`).\n",

      "Building your own user authentication in Python with FastAPI requires careful attention to security best practices.  Rolling your own auth system is generally discouraged unless you have very specific needs not met by existing solutions (like Auth0, Firebase, etc.), but if you proceed, here's a breakdown of best practices:\n",
      "\n",
      "**I. Password Handling:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Hashing:**  **Never** store passwords in plain text.  Use a strong, one-way hashing algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2.  These are designed to be computationally expensive to crack, even with rainbow tables.  Python's `bcrypt` library is a good choice.  Avoid MD5 and SHA-1; they are considered insecure.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Salting:**  Always salt your passwords before hashing.  A salt is a random string added to the password before hashing.  This prevents attackers from pre-computing hashes for common passwords.  The salt should be unique for each password and stored alongside the hashed password.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Key Stretching:**  Use a sufficiently high iteration count for your hashing algorithm.  This increases the computational cost for attackers, making cracking more difficult.  Bcrypt and Argon2 handle this automatically through parameters you set.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Password Complexity Requirements:**  Enforce strong password policies on the client-side (frontend) and server-side.  Require a minimum length, a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.  Validate these requirements before even starting the hashing process.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Password Reset Functionality:**  Implement a secure password reset mechanism.  Use time-limited tokens (e.g., via email) to verify user identity and prevent attacks.  Consider using a library that specializes in this for extra security.\n",
      "\n",
      "**II. Authentication Mechanisms:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):**  JWTs are a popular choice for stateless authentication.  After successful authentication, issue a JWT containing user information (ID, roles, etc.).  This token is then passed in subsequent requests (e.g., in the `Authorization` header).  Libraries like `PyJWT` simplify JWT handling.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Session Management (with caution):**  Session-based authentication is more stateful and requires careful consideration of security.  If you use sessions, employ robust session management techniques, including:\n",
      "    * Secure cookies (HTTPOnly and Secure flags) to prevent client-side scripting attacks.\n",
      "    * Short session lifetimes.\n",
      "    * Regularly rotating session IDs.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **API Keys (for non-user authentication):** If you need to authenticate APIs or services, use API keys.  Consider different key types with varying levels of permissions.  Store API keys securely and revoke them when necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "**III. Security Best Practices:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Always validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS)).\n",
      "\n",
      "* **HTTPS:**  Use HTTPS to encrypt communication between the client and the server.  This protects passwords and other sensitive data from eavesdropping.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.  This limits the number of authentication attempts from a single IP address within a specific time window.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Regular Security Audits:**  Regularly review your code and security practices to identify and address vulnerabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Output Encoding:**  Properly encode outputs to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.  Use template engines or escape functions where appropriate to handle data in HTML context.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Error Handling:** Avoid giving detailed error messages that might expose sensitive information about your system. Generic error messages are better for security.\n",

      "\n",
      "**1. Client-side vs. Server-side Discovery:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Client-side discovery:** Clients are responsible for finding the addresses of services.  This often uses a service registry (like Consul, etcd, ZooKeeper, or even a simple database).\n",
      "\n",
      "    * **Pros:**\n",
      "        * **Simplicity (potentially):**  Can be simpler to implement initially, especially with less complex deployments.\n",
      "        * **Resilience (potentially):** Clients can have built-in retries and fallback mechanisms.\n",
      "        * **Flexibility:** Clients can choose their load balancing strategies.\n",
      "    * **Cons:**\n",
      "        * **Increased client complexity:** Clients need to handle service discovery logic, increasing their codebase and testing burden.\n",
      "        * **Tight coupling:** Clients are directly coupled to the service registry.  A change in the registry's format or location requires client updates.\n",
      "        * **Scalability issues:**  Clients need to maintain their own service registry knowledge, potentially overwhelming them in large deployments.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Server-side discovery:** A dedicated component (often a reverse proxy like Nginx or HAProxy, or a service mesh like Istio or Linkerd) handles service discovery. Clients interact with this component, which forwards requests to the appropriate services.\n",
      "\n",
      "    * **Pros:**\n",
      "        * **Simplified clients:** Clients don't need service discovery logic, reducing their complexity.\n",
      "        * **Loose coupling:** Clients are decoupled from the service registry. Changes in the registry don't impact clients directly.\n",
      "        * **Centralized management:**  Easier to manage load balancing, health checks, and other infrastructure concerns.\n",
      "        * **Enhanced security:**  The server-side component can handle authentication and authorization.\n",
      "    * **Cons:**\n",
      "        * **Increased complexity:** Requires managing and maintaining an additional component.\n",
      "        * **Single point of failure (potential):** The discovery component becomes a critical dependency.  Proper redundancy and high availability are crucial.\n",
      "        * **Performance overhead:**  Adds an extra hop in the request path.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Specific Service Discovery Mechanisms:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Centralized Registries (Consul, etcd, ZooKeeper):**\n",
      "\n",
      "    * **Pros:**  Mature, feature-rich, support multiple consistency models, provide health checks, and are widely adopted.\n",
      "    * **Cons:**  Introduce a single point of failure (unless properly clustered), can be complex to set up and manage.  May introduce latency due to the extra network hop.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Peer-to-peer (Gossip protocols):**\n",
      "\n",
      "    * **Pros:**  Decentralized, highly resilient, no single point of failure.\n",
      "    * **Cons:**  More complex to implement, can be less efficient than centralized approaches for large deployments.  Potentially slower convergence on service locations.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **DNS-based Service Discovery:**\n",
      "\n",
      "    * **Pros:**  Leverages existing infrastructure, relatively simple to implement.  Many load balancers already integrate with DNS.\n",
      "    * **Cons:**  Can be slower to update than other methods due to DNS TTLs.  May require custom DNS solutions for complex scenarios.  Doesn't intrinsically handle health checks.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Service Mesh (Istio, Linkerd):**\n",
      "\n",
      "    * **Pros:**  Provides advanced features like traffic management, observability, security, and automated service discovery.\n",

      "* **`id`:** The unique identifier for the hook.  It matches the name of the tool.\n",

      "* **`args`:** This allows you to pass extra arguments to the tool.  The examples show:\n",
      "    * **`codespell`**: `--quiet` suppresses unnecessary output, and `--ignore-words-file=.codespell-ignore` allows you to specify a file containing words to ignore. Create this file (`touch .codespell-ignore`) and add any words that codespell should ignore.\n",
      "    * **`black`**: `--line-length=79` sets the maximum line length to 79 characters. Adjust this if needed to fit your preferred style.\n",
      "    * **`isort`**: `--profile=black` configures isort to match Black's import ordering and style.  This ensures consistent formatting across the codebase.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Install `pre-commit`:**  If you haven't already, install pre-commit: `pip install pre-commit`\n",
      "2. **Create the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file:** Save this YAML content as `.pre-commit-config.yaml` in your project's root directory.\n",
      "3. **Run `pre-commit install`:** This command installs the hooks into your Git repository.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, every time you try to commit changes, pre-commit will automatically run codespell, black, and isort on your Python files before the commit is allowed.  This will help to maintain a consistent and clean codebase.  Remember to periodically update the `rev` numbers in your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file to benefit from the latest improvements and bug fixes.\n",

      "    print(\"File not found!\")\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This version explicitly handles the `FileNotFoundError` exception, making it robust to situations where the file doesn't exist.  The `end=''` in the `print()` function prevents adding an extra newline character, matching the bash script's behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Option 2: More concise approach**\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach leverages Python's exception handling and file iteration capabilities for a more compact solution:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "filename = \"README.md\"\n",

However, for extremely large files, this might consume more memory than iterating line by line (as in Option 1).  Choose the option that best suits your needs and the expected size of the files you'll be processing.\n",
