      "• The author notes that while the new blender seems to work okay, the quality of the product has decreased over time and the base of the blender doesn't look as good as previous models. They plan to use it carefully to avoid any issues.\n",
      "• After about a year, the motor in the blender started making a funny noise, but since the warranty had expired, the author had to purchase another one. The author attributes this decline in quality to companies relying on brand recognition and consumer loyalty rather than producing high-quality products.\n"
